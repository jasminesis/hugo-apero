  I'm currently a second-year Master's student in [Applied Statistics for Social Science Research](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/programs/applied-statistics-social-science-research) at NYU. I was a Teaching Assistant for Intermediate Quantitative Methods in Fall 2023, and will be a Course Assistant for Ravi Shroff again, for Messy Data and Machine Learning in Spring 2024. I had a great time holding office hours, teaching and learning, and am looking forward to my final semester! I am also helping out with thinkCausal, a causal inference tool for social scientists.
